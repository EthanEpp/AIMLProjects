The fit was as expected, and these pieces could easily be worn for travel or just lounging around the house. They washed up nicely, but I wouldn't recommend putting them in the dryer due to possible shrinkage."" —H. Brien Price: $39.99+ (available in sizes S–XL and in 20 colors) Promising review: ""Originally, I wanted a comfy outfit for air travel and bought this before my last trip to Mexico. As soon as I put it on, I fell in love with it. I now live in it. It's comfortable and fits perfectly. I will be purchasing more!"" —Meg Fanslow Price: $32.99+ (available in sizes S–2XL and 17 colors and styles) Promising review: ""This two-piece set is my true travel companion. It's like Goldilocks found the just right porridge of clothing fabrics — not too thin to be mistaken for a cobweb, not too heavy to turn me into a walking sauna. Plus, it comes in short and long-sleeved versions. And let's be honest, jumpsuits are cute, but using the bathroom in them is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while riding a unicycle. This two-piece set? Bathroom access is easier than opening a fridge door. No contortions, no wardrobe malfunctions, just pure, unadulterated bladder bliss."" —Amazon Customer Price: $40.99 (available in sizes S–3XL and 32 colors) Promising review: ""When we decided to take our Christmas vacation to the UK and Ireland, I knew that I would need a good warm rain jacket. I read tons of reviews before purchasing this, and I am so glad that I got this jacket! I wore it almost every single day on our two-week trip. I brought a long, heavy coat to wear but ended up leaving it behind most days and wore this instead. In the pouring rain and wind, it held up perfectly. The length was perfect. I loved how the waist cinched in and gave me some shape rather than making me look boxy. I was able to wear layers underneath and not feel confined whatsoever. This was a great rain jacket for a trip, but I am even more excited to have it in my collection at home, too!"" —Jill Foster Price: $50.99 (available in sizes XS–3XL and 12 colors) Promising review: ""Really nice scarf. It seems almost hand-made with the finest of yarn. I live in harsh Michigan winters and walk my dog outside every day, so this thing gets a workout. And keeps me warm!

Great fit and I love the adjustable straps! The color is vibrant and amazing."" —Amazon Customer Price: $32.99 (available in sizes S–XL and 21 colors) Promising review: ""I bought this right before a trip to Greece for a bit of sun protection. I have to say. It was even better than I thought it would be. The material is light yet durable. Furthermore, any wrinkles generally disappeared after hanging the shirt, which made this the perfect travel shirt!"" —C Davis. Price: $29.98 (available in sizes S–2XL and 39 styles) Promising review: ""This is by far the best money spent on clothing! I love this outfit, it's so comfortable! I will say the tag was a bit itchy on the top piece, so I had to cut it off, but otherwise, it's 20/10. This outfit is what I treat myself to on my self-care days and relaxing moments. Personally, I don't think I'd wear it out and about, but around the house, it is just so perfect! And what I look like in my own house doesn't matter, but my comfort definitely does!"" —Wendy Price: $52.99 (available in sizes S–XL and 29 styles) Check out this activewear essential on TikTok here. Promising review: ""Honestly, I saw this on TikTok and contemplated getting it for a long time. I’m so glad I committed! It’s extremely comfortable. The padding is amazing, so you don’t have to worry about a bra underneath at all. You can wear it with sweats or leggings to the gym or even dress it up for a night out. Considering more colors for sure!"" —Kristyn Long Price: $22.99+ (available in sizes S–2XL and 20 colors) Promising review: ""These leggings are AMAZING! Not only are they soft, comfortable, and squatproof, but they look so good! I have a hard time finding leggings that are big enough around the thighs/butt area but fit enough around the waistline.

And looks great on a pear body shape."" —K Price: $49.99 (available in sizes XS–XL and eight colors) Promising review: ""I bought these shoes a couple of years ago before a river hike. UM THESE ARE AWESOME. They lasted a long time, and the only reason I bought these yellow ones was because I wanted a new color, haha. My older pair did start to wear out in the toes from scraping them on rocks and such when hiking, but still no holes in them. These shoes feel like socks but with enough of a sole that you can walk on gravel with no problem. It really is like walking barefoot. Also, these are the only water shoes that I have worn that do NOT let a bunch of debris into the shoe, making you constantly have to take it off to empty it or just deal with the irritant. You can play on the beach with minimal sand stuck between your toes. Thoroughly impressed by that. So, with that, I do recommend if you are a half size to size down so they are snug; otherwise, the sock-like ability to keep stuff out might not work so well."" —Samantha Lindsay Price: $9.88+ (available in seven sizes and 49 colors) Promising review: ""Great cover up for cover up for beach! It's covered enough to just throw on and walk to the beach without feeling like you're out and about in your swimsuit.

Promising review: ""I normally cannot wear flats because they give me terrible blisters on the back of my feet. These didn't! Bought these in nude for a city vacation with a lot of walking, but where sandals aren't necessarily worn, and these were perfect! They obviously don't have the support of sneakers, but I am so happy to finally have a cheap pair of flats that don't give me blisters. I did break them in with thin socks around my house before wearing them out, and when possible, I wear them with little sock liners. Also — I was able to fold these in half like Tieks and fit them in a semi-small purse to change into to dance at a wedding! Score!"" —Kate Price: $15.60+ (available in women's sizes 5–15, including wide sizes, and 20 styles) Promising review: ""I absolutely LOVE this dress! It is very comfortable and perfect for summer!

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption A view of the Montana State Capitol on May 3, 2023, in Helena, Montana. Three Montana laws restricting abortion rights, including a ban on abortions after 20 weeks, have been struck down in court as unconstitutional. District Court Judge Kurt Krueger wrote in his ruling that the regulations attempt to impose severe burdens on abortion access without clear justification or credible evidence. The laws, passed by the Montana legislature in 2021, would have banned abortion at 20 weeks, barred doctors from prescribing medication abortions via telehealth services, required a 24-hour waiting period for medication abortions, and would have required doctors to offer an ultrasound before an abortion. The laws had been blocked by a preliminary injunction that was granted in October 2021. Under the court's ruling, the laws cannot be enforced. Krueger's decision referenced a Montana Supreme Court precedent from 1999 finding the state's constitutional right to privacy protects access to pre-viability abortion. The state's high court reaffirmed that precedent in a ruling last spring. A spokesperson for Attorney General of Montana Austin Knudsen said the state plans to appeal the ruling to the Montana Supreme Court, saying he's committed to ""protecting the health and safety of women and unborn babies."" Republicans in the state legislature continue to push for restrictions on abortion access. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the Thursday ruling a critical victory. ""As we celebrate today, we will continue to build on this win to fight for equitable abortion access in Montana and beyond,"" McGill said in a statement, adding that Montana will remain a crucial access point for those seeking abortion in the Rocky Mountain West. Several more anti-abortion rights laws are facing court challenges in Montana, including half a dozen from the 2023 legislative session. All anti-abortion rights restrictions, except for one requiring parental notification for patients 15-years-old or younger, have been blocked in court while those lawsuits play out.", Montana,"(47.3752671, -109.638757)"
Jack Teixeira expected to plead guilty in documents leak case,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1235070967/jack-teixeira-expected-to-plead-guilty-in-documents-leak-case,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/02/29/gettyimages-1251791995_wide-d3a4a5f4ee5413341a60d906cb7bf28ac4429430-s1400-c100.jpg,NPR,2024-02-29T23:00:33Z,"Ryan Lucas This photo illustration shows national guardsman Jack Teixeira reflected in an image of the Pentagon. Stefani Reynolds /AFP via Getty Images hide caption This photo illustration shows national guardsman Jack Teixeira reflected in an image of the Pentagon. Jack Teixeira, the former Air National guardsman charged with leaking classified military documents online, is expected to plead guilty in the case. Prosecutors on Thursday filed a motion in federal court in Boston asking for a change of plea hearing next week. The request comes almost a year after Teixeira was arrested and charged with the illegal retention and transmission of national defense information. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charges. Teixiera was indicted in June 2023 by a federal grand jury in Boston following his arrest that April after he allegedly shared highly classified military documents about the war in Ukraine, in addition to other to national security issues on Discord, the social media site. According to charging documents, Teixeira had worked in the 102nd Intelligence Wing based at Otis Air Force Base in Cape Cod, Mass., since May 2022 until his arrest. He was a cyber transports systems journeyman — similar to an information technology specialist — for the National Guard. His unit provides worldwide intelligence for combat support and homeland security. Teixeira was granted a ""top secret security clearance"" in 2021, meaning he would have signed a ""lifetime binding non-disclosure agreement"" acknowledging that leaking protected information could result in criminal charges, according to the federal complaint. According to the court documents, a social media user suspected of being Teixeira began releasing classified information in ""paragraphs of text"" onto a social media platform later revealed to be Discord as early as December 2022. Initially, the purpose of divulging secret information was to ""discuss geopolitical affairs and current and historical wars,"" the federal complaint said. But beginning in January, the online user began posting photographs of what appeared to be official U.S. government documents with classification markings. Among the documents photographed was the status of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including troop movements on a particular date. The leaker later explained to another user that he was concerned that he would get in trouble for ""making the transcriptions of text in the workplace"" so he began taking the documents to his residence and photographing them, another online user known to have interacted with the leaker told the FBI. Following the leaks, the Air National Guard took action against 15 service members, ranging from sergeants to colonels, for dereliction of duties for not stopping Teixeira's alleged activity. Some were fired, others received administrative punishment. Col. Sean Riley, who headed the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod, was relieved of command. The Guard said it also suspended other commanders and said the 102nd Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group was ""taken off mission"" when Teixeira was discovered as the source of the unauthorized disclosures. The Air Force Inspector General's report painted a damning picture of inaction by officials in Teixeira's unit, who were repeatedly aware of what he was doing. ""Had any of these members come forward, security officials would likely have facilitated restricting systems/facility access and alerted the appropriate authorities, reducing the length and depth of the unauthorized and unlawful disclosures by several months,"" the report said.

Will the timing of the Supreme Court's Trump case mean no trial before the election?,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1235017841/supreme-court-trump-immunity-hearing,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/02/29/2023-10-04-dc-stock--cdull--14-2_wide-6900ea49b945ccf9b1f6fb66fe0c57c3e6aca6a3-s1400-c100.jpg,NPR,2024-02-29T22:53:45Z,"Nina Totenberg The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to hear arguments in April about whether former President Trump enjoys blanket immunity. Catie Dull/NPR hide caption The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to hear arguments in April about whether former President Trump enjoys blanket immunity. The Supreme Court's decision to hear former President Trump's immunity claim, and the timing of it, have enormous consequences--not just for Trump, but for the American political system, and for the court itself. Nobody really knows what's going on behind the scenes at the Supreme Court. But there are hints, as well as questions. Among the questions are these: Why did the court decline special counsel Jack Smith's request to hear the immunity case in December, but agree to hear Trump's appeal now? And why, when Trump appealed, did the court take more than two weeks to say it would hear his case, and then set a briefing schedule that all but ensures that Trump will either face trial during the presidential campaign or possibly not face trial at all. ""Surely the court was aware that timing is everything here,"" says UCLA law professor Richard Hasen. ""And the fact that they set this for the last week of the term when they're going to be the busiest that they are going to be all year...it looks like they recognize that this trial may well not happen before the election."" The court could have moved faster. It has historically done that in other big cases with political ramification. Indeed, in Bush v. Gore the court decided the 2000 election in three days. And in the Watergate tapes case, the court ruled against President Nixon 16 days after oral argument. What makes this term different is that there are a dozen huge non-Trump-related landmine cases that are pending, several to be argued in April, and none yet decided. Given that, University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck says he thinks that the schedule the court set out Wednesday is pretty speedy. And he thinks the court could deliver an opinion in the Trump immunity case by the end of May. A hint of that is what he calls the ""weird language"" in the court's order yesterday, language that suggests the lower courts could proceed to trial faster than usual if the Supreme Court rules against the former president. Both Hasen and Vladeck agree on one thingâ€”the pivotal role that likely has been played and will be played in this case by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. While other members of the court have served in the executive branch, Kavanaugh is the justice who has worked most closely with a president. He was staff secretary to George W. Bush and worked with him on a daily basis. As Vladeck observes, Kavanaugh ""has a uniquely pro-executive perspective, not just having been in the White House, but having been in that White House at a period of time when the White House was claiming as much power as we've ever seen a White House claim."" Most defenders of executive power believe that the president, and presumably a former president, is entitled to a hearing at the Supreme Court in any non-frivolous case that that involves him personally. Trump, of course, is a former president, and it's hard to find a scholar who believes that he has total immunity now that he is out of office. ""Even an executive power person like Justice Kavanaugh surely doesn't believe that a president could order SEAL Team Six to assassinate political rivals without facing potential criminal consequences,"" says Hasen. The forever shield from criminal prosecution that Trump is advocating would allow just such immunity. His lawyers conceded the point in the lower court. ""The problem that President Trump is going to run into at the end of the day is even the most generous reading of a line between official and non-official acts puts at least much of the January 6th indictment on the non-official side of the line,"" says Vladeck. ""I don't see any universe where the court would say he has immunity for all of it."" The hitch, says Vladeck, is that if the court delivers that kind of a ""mixed decision,"" how much does that ""throw a wrench in the trial clock?"" When and how the Supreme Court decides the Trump case will undoubtedly affect other Trump cases awaiting trial. The election interference case in Georgia almost certainly will not take place before the election. But when and if it takes places, Vladeck notes that ""there is nothing about being president that requires you to call the secretary of state of Georgia and ask him to find 11,000 more votes."" That is ""even more true"" in the Mar-a-Lago case, he says, because the charges involve allegations that the former president illegally removed classified documents from the White House and then obstructed government efforts to get them back--charges that only involve Trump's conduct after he left the White House. And finally there is the New York case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016, also at a time when Trump was not president. Even though the stakes are ""the most trivial,"" in the New York case, Hasen observes, the trial is not in doubt. Jury selection is set to begin March 25, and Hasen says that some of the district attorney's theories under New York law ""are more plausible than I first thought in terms of... this being a felony.""",,

Deborah Feingold/Corbis via Getty Images hide caption Portrait of American jazz musician, composer and band leader Jackie McLean, Hartford, Conn., 1979. Hartford, Conn., falls under the radar by most standards. A relatively small city smack dab between New York and Boston, it's been dubbed the ""Insurance Capital of the World"" and was, at one point, home of the Whalers, a beloved hockey franchise. When it comes to jazz, though, the Greater Hartford area stands out as one of the hippest creative communities. It boasts the longest-running free jazz concert series (Paul Brown Monday Night Jazz); has produced countless musicians who are recording and touring all over the world (from pianist Brad Mehldau to drummer Cindy Blackman); and has become a destination for jazz education through community arts organizations, Essentially Ellington-winning public high school music programs and world-class universities. The city wouldn't be where it is without the arrival of alto saxophonist Jackie McLean over 50 years ago. 1 of 7 The Harlem-born and raised musician made a name for himself as a ubiquitous fixture on the hard bop scene during the 1950s and 1960s with his unmistakable tone. After tenures in Miles Davis' early groups and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, McLean embarked on a prolific run of albums as a leader on the Blue Note Records label. The loss of his Cabaret Card however, sent McLean on a path of teaching and mentorship — with the University of Hartford as an eventual destination for McLean and his family. At a time when jazz was not widely seen in higher education, McLean brought the wisdom learned on the bandstand to the classroom; he transformed the school into a destination for aspiring musicians to learn from one of the masters. His commitment to Hartford extended beyond the campus of the university with the founding of The Artists Collective, an arts nonprofit for youth in the area that provides an educational springboard for young musicians. The list of alumni from the University of Hartford and The Artists Collective reads like a who's who of top jazz talent on the scene — and is one of the defining examples of McLean's impact on the city and beyond. This episode, we'll hear stories from family, friends, and some of those students — who are playing and teaching the music themselves — carrying on the legacy of Jackie McLean.

Judge skeptical of lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's X over hate speech research,https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1234901186/judge-skeptical-of-lawsuit-brought-by-elon-musks-x-over-hate-speech-research,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/02/29/ap23146572000583_wide-e33ca71714be6458edfd7c71de9ec8906eac040f-s1400-c100.jpg,NPR,2024-02-29T22:37:30Z,"Bobby Allyn Elon Musk departs the Phillip Burton Federal Building and United States Court House in San Francisco, on Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2023. Benjamin Fanjoy/AP hide caption Elon Musk departs the Phillip Burton Federal Building and United States Court House in San Francisco, on Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2023. A federal judge in San Francisco appears poised to toss a lawsuit brought by Elon's Musk's X against a nonprofit that found the platform allowed hate speech to spread on the site once known as Twitter. Last year, lawyers for X sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate, claiming the group improperly scraped X to prepare damning reports about the proliferation of hate speech on the site. But in a hearing over Zoom on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer appeared highly skeptical of the case, devoting the majority of the proceeding to grilling Musk's lawyer over why the lawsuit was brought at all. Jon Hawk, X's lawyer, said at core the suit is about honoring data security agreements to protect the platform's users. Breyer was unconvinced. ""You put that in terms of safety, and I've got to tell you, I guess you can use that word, but I can't think of anything basically more antithetical to the First Amendment than this process of silencing people from publicly disseminated information once it's been published,"" Breyer said. ""You're trying to shoehorn this theory by using these words into a viable breach of contract claim,"" the judge added. X contends that the CCDH violated the platform's terms of service by using a third-party tool called Brandwatch to analyze posts on the site to prepare reports critical of X. The social media company argued that, in the process, CCDH gained unauthorized access to nonpublic data. Much of Thursday's hearing turned on what exactly constitutes scraping and whether the center did indeed violate X's terms of service by collecting data for its reports. X is seeking damages from the center, arguing that the platform lost tens of millions of dollars from advertisers fleeing the site in the wake of the nonprofit's findings. But in order to make this case, X had to show the group knew the financial loss was ""foreseeable"" when it started its account and began abiding by Twitter's terms of service, in 2019, before Musk acquired the site. X lawyer Hawk argued that the platform's terms of service state that the rules for the site could change at any time, including that suspended users whom the group says spread hate speech could be reinstated. And so, Hawk said, if changes to the rules were foreseeable, then the financial loss from its reports on users spreading hate should have also been foreseeable. This logic confused and frustrated the judge. ""That, of course, reduces foreseeability to one of the most vapid extensions of law I've ever heard,"" Breyer said. John Quinn, an attorney for CCDH, said the researchers' use of the third-party search tool never accessed non-public posts ""This idea that this is about data security, this is about user data, there was something to investigate, is implausible,"" Quinn said. Among CCDH's reports was one highlighting how X took no action against 99 out of 100 users it flagged for posting hate, including racism, homophobia and Neo-Nazism. Research into the uptick of hate speech on X has in part fueled an exodus among advertisers on the platform that has so kneecapped the company that Musk himself has repeatedly floated the possibility of bankruptcy. Late late year, major advertisers like Walmart, Apple, Disney and IBM stopped advertising on X after Musk endorsed an antisemitic post that claimed Jewish communities push hatred of white people. In response, Musk lashed out. He told companies: ""Don't advertise"" and used the F-word on the stage of a public event to curse out firms that distanced themselves from the platform. CCDH, through its spokespeople and staff, has tied its legal battle with Musk to last year's boycott. The group has portrayed X's lawsuit as Musk's attempt to silence criticism, and in Thursday's hearing, the group cited California's so-called anti-SLAPP laws â€” which protect people and groups from frivolous lawsuits aimed at suppressing free speech. ""Everything in that statute recognizes that very often the litigation itself is the punishment,"" Quinn told the judge. ""We are representing a non-profit organization here being sued by the world's richest man."" Near the end of the hearing, the judge asked why X didn't bring a defamation suit if the company believes its reputation has been harmed by the nonprofit organization. But one cannot win a defamation suit, he noted, if the statements being challenged are true. ""You could've brought a defamation case, you didn't bring a defamation case,"" Breyer said. ""And that's significant.""", San Francisco,"(37.7792588, -122.4193286)"

IOWA CITY, Iowa — Iowa's Caitlin Clark, who is on the verge of becoming the all-time NCAA scoring leader in college basketball, announced Thursday that she will leave the Hawkeyes after this season and enter the WNBA Draft. ""While this season is far from over and we have a lot more goals to achieve, it will be my last one at Iowa,"" Clark wrote in a post on the X social media platform. She thanked her teammates, coaches and the thousands of fans who have packed arenas across the country to watch her and the sixth-ranked Hawkeyes. Clark emerged as a focal point for women's basketball, with her flashy play and 3-point shot, often from the on-court logo. Many players would have been benched for shooting from so far out, but Clark had the green light from her coach and she has delivered while also finding her teammates and hitting the boards. The guard, with one more year of eligibility, became the all-time leading women's scorer in major college basketball by scoring 33 points to pass Lynette Woodard and post her 17th career triple-double in a 108-60 victory over Minnesota on Wednesday night. Clark also broke the NCAA single-season record by sinking eight 3-pointers for a total of 156 in 2023-24. She now has 3,650 career points. Woodard had 3,649 points for Kansas from 1977-81, before the NCAA sanctioned the sport. Earlier this month, Clark broke Kelsey Plum's NCAA scoring record (3,527 points). Next up is the overall NCAA scoring record of Pete Maravich, who is just 17 points ahead of her.", Iowa,"(41.9216734, -93.3122705)"

Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images hide caption Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers his annual state of the nation address in Moscow on Thursday. MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual state of the nation address on Thursday, issuing explicit nuclear threats to the West even as he assured Russians their country could both emerge victorious from the war in Ukraine and thrive economically at home. The Kremlin billed the speech as akin to a campaign platform reveal — no less than Putin's vision for Russia's future ahead of a March election in which he faces no serious competition for a fifth term in office. But the Kremlin leader made no mention of the vote, as he blended belligerence with optimism in a sprawling, two-hour-plus speech before Russia's Federal Assembly that in its opening moments touched most heavily on the now 2-year-old war in Ukraine. Putin warned that if Ukraine's Western backers deepened their involvement in the war, such as sending troops, the consequences for the ""invaders"" would be ""tragic"" and it would risk starting a nuclear war. ""They must realize that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory,"" Putin said, in apparent reference to increasingly lethal Western weapons provided to Kyiv. ""What they are now suggesting and scaring the world with — all that raises the real threat of a nuclear conflict that will mean the destruction of our civilization."" The remarks came just days after French President Emmanuel Macron said Western countries should not rule out deploying ground troops in Ukraine. NATO allies, including the United States, publicly rejected the suggestion. Putin denied recent U.S. accusations that Russia intends to launch nuclear weapons into space, calling the accusations U.S. ""demagoguery"" and an American election-year stunt designed to lure Russia into arms negotiations talks. He also accused the West of deliberately drawing the Soviet Union into a self-depleting arms race — and vowed Russia would play it smarter this time around. ""Our task is to develop a military industrial complex in a way that increases the scientific, technological and industrial potential of the country,"" Putin said. As he has in the past, Putin touted the Russian economy's ability to withstand Western sanctions over the war — praising a decade-long government effort to buffer the Russian market even as he acknowledged there was much work still to be done. The Kremlin leader unveiled a list of long-term goals, from increasing the national birthrate and workers' wages to improving outputs in agriculture and industry. It felt at times like an echo of the five-year economic plans much touted but rarely implemented in the heyday of the USSR. Much of the address was dedicated to a slew of new government programs aimed at improving Russians' lives — with Putin promising more money for families, children, schools and small-to-midsize businesses. Putin also announced a program akin to the U.S. GI Bill for Russian veterans of the war in Ukraine, calling them the country's ""new elite,"" destined to fill the future ranks of business and government. If there were concerns over how Russia's government could afford both the war and social spending, they were left unsaid. Applause from increasingly fidgety dignitaries kept coming. As he has throughout the conflict, Putin insisted Russians had united behind the war effort, despite growing evidence of divisions and war fatigue.

One anti-war politician who was gaining popularity toward a campaign for the presidential election was disqualified by the electoral commission, which said there were irregularities in signatures gathered to get his name on the ballot. The death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny under mysterious circumstances in a remote Russian prison colony this month has drawn only further global attention to government repression of anti-war sentiment. And families of civilians mobilized for the war effort in 2022 have also grown increasingly vocal with calls to bring their loved ones home from the front. It appears they are not alone. A new independent poll suggests that a large majority of Russians — 75% — would endorse Putin signing a peace agreement ""tomorrow.""", Ukraine,"(49.4871968, 31.2718321)"
